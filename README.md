# Theatre
This application is designed to manage reservations for a theatre. When the application starts, users are prompted to either create an account or log in using an email and password, set up during account creation.
### Client:
After selecting the client option, users will see various choices. They can view upcoming shows and make reservations for specific performances they wish to attend. Once a show is selected, they can purchase tickets (as many as they wish, based on auditorium capacity and ticket availability). Users can also view their reservations on a dedicated page.
### Staff - Actors:
Actors have access to a specific part of the application. They can see their scheduled shows and the characters they will portray. Additionally, they can view their payment details for each performance.
### Staff - CEO :
The CEO has the ability to plan shows, set ticket prices, assign payments, and select the auditorium where each show will be held. They can also manage actors, including hiring, firing, and adjusting salaries.
### Order:
To make a reservation, a user must be logged in. When a reservation is created, a seat is also booked and recorded after purchase, ensuring it cannot be booked by others. Once an event has taken place, the reservation is removed from the list where users can view their reservations.
